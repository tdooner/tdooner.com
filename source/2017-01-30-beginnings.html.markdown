Tomorrow, I begin my next adventure: a 9-month fellowship with [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org).

I'll be working with Multnomah County, Oregon (which includes Portland) to implement [a web app](http://github.com/slco-2016/clientcomm) that facilitates communication between victims of crime and case workers that are helping them apply for assistance from the state.

Victims assistance programs pay for medical bills, funerals, mental health consuling, and other expenses, so that the victims can get back to a semblance of normalcy and don't have to turn to crime or drugs. (California spends [$62M](http://vcgcb.ca.gov/victims/statistics/fy12-13.aspx) annually, Oregon spends [$60M](http://www.doj.state.or.us/about/pdf/15-17_doj_lab_agency_summary.pdf).)

## Becoming more political
There's a lot of unfortunate stuff happening in America right now. Xenophobia, threats to healthcare, and questionable leadership all over the place.

I had hoped that my time at [Brigade](https://www.brigade.com) would chip away at this. I learned a lot while I was there, and am thoroughly glad I had the opportunity to work there. However, I am glad to now be working in a more explicitly political role. I hope I won't even need to be partisan in order to do it. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of existing social programs should be non-partisan.

I'm approaching this new opportunity as my chance to become more politically engaged and hopefully use my skills to make a difference in peoples' lives. Even if it's only be a handful in Portland, you've gotta start somewhere.
