Hello from the darkness.

It's been a while since I've written anything here, and that's about to change.
I've resolved to "write more" in 2016, and I know of no better forum than this
blog.

Since "write more" isn't exactly a [SMART-compliant
goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria), let me clarify.

In 2016 I hope to *write one blog post a week*. Each post will probably be
boringâ€”too technical or not technical enough. But right now, my audience is
entirely my friends, and I'm going to peer pressure you into reading my
thoughts anyways.

So, subscribe to my RSS feed at

your favorite feed reader (Newsblur? Feedly?), or watch [my
Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomdooner)/Facebook for weekly updates.
