<p>Tomorrow, I begin my next adventure: a 9-month fellowship with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>.</p>

<p>I'll be working with Multnomah County, Oregon (which includes Portland) to implement <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/slco-2016/clientcomm">a web app</a> that facilitates communication between victims of crime and case workers that are helping them apply for assistance from the state.</p>

<p>Victims assistance programs are important to help victims pay for medical bills, funerals, mental health consuling, and other expenses. This helps victims get back to a semblance of normalcy so they don't have to turn to crime or drugs. (California spends <a target="_blank" href="http://vcgcb.ca.gov/victims/statistics/fy12-13.aspx">$62M</a> annually, Oregon spends <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doj.state.or.us/about/pdf/15-17_doj_lab_agency_summary.pdf">$60M</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="becoming-more-political">Becoming more political</h2>
<p>There's a lot of unfortunate stuff happening in America right now. Xenophobia, threats to healthcare, and questionable leadership all over the place.</p>

<p>In my two years at Brigade, I hoped that our product would facilitate a better political climate, and this would spare me from an oblication to be politically involved outside of work. It's now becoming evident to me that <strong>this is not enough</strong>. Creating a platform and hoping for the best isn't going to help actual people, right now.</p>

<p>The only problem is, <em>I don't know the best way I can help people</em>. Hopefully, something will come of the gigantic national movements, but helping on that scale is daunting. <em>City</em> government, however, seems like a great scale: a large impact on residents' lives with less bureaucracy. This scale is part of what made me apply for the fellowship.</p>

<h2 id="toward-the-future">Toward the future</h2>

<p>I'm approaching this new opportunity as my chance to become more politically engaged and hopefully use my skills to make a difference in peoples' lives. Even if it's only be a handful in Portland, you've gotta start somewhere.</p>

<p>And, if this is inspiring to you, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/join-us/join-our-team">Code for America is hiring</a>!</p>
